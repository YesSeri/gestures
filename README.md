# Gesturing Mouse

## Idea

This is an extension for Google Chrome. I used a firefox extension around 2009 that made it possible to do commands by holding right click and moving the mouse. I can't find it anymore and wanted to do my own take on it. Instead of right mouse button, I will use a keyboard key. I feel it is to invasive to use the right mouse button, because then I would need to disable the right click menu. In the future I might make it so you can bind MB4 and MB5 if you want. Maybe also pressing MB3 down. 

## Things to do

- Finish an early version of the extension
- Hardcode the commands you can choose from. 
  - Later make a config file with `chrome.storage.sync.get` and `.set` 
- Make a small menu with info about the extension in the google extension menu.
  - Make it so you can choose custom commands from a dropdown menu here.
- One advanced feature I want is that you should be able to move the mouse around all over, "tagging links" and then you do an open links command. That will open all the links you've tagged in new tabs.
